# What is SACD DSD and Where to Find It?
 
SACD DSD is a high-resolution audio format that uses Direct Stream Digital (DSD) encoding to store music on Super Audio CD (SACD) discs. DSD is a 1-bit audio format that samples the audio signal at 2.8224 MHz, which is 64 times higher than the standard CD sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. DSD can capture more details and nuances of the original sound than conventional PCM formats, such as WAV or FLAC.
